I am writing to express my enthusiasm and gratitude for the opportunity to intern as a web developer at CodSoft. Over the course of my internship, I have been actively engaged in various projects, focusing primarily on JavaScript development.

In Task 1, 
I successfully designed and implemented a dynamic to-do list application. I incorporated user-friendly features such as the ability to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. To enhance user experience, I included a feature allowing users to set multiple background 
wallpapers based on personal preferences. This task not only honed my JavaScript skills but also showcased my attention to detail in creating a functional and visually appealing interface.

In Task 2,
It involved the creation of a portfolio, where I aimed to showcase my skills and experiences. I incorporated a dark mode option, considering the popular preference for this mode. The portfolio features a brief about myself, providing visitors with insights into my
background and expertise. Additionally, I added a footer and various HTML tags to ensure a well-structured and aesthetically pleasing presentation.

In Task 3,
It challenged me to develop a digital clock capable of displaying the time not only for India but also for other countries. I implemented a unique feature where the background dynamically changes based on whether it is AM or PM. The morning hours are emphasized 
with a soothing blue shade, while the night hours are highlighted with a distinctive black background. This task allowed me to delve into time zone functionalities and further enhanced my proficiency in JavaScript.

Throughout these tasks, I have demonstrated my dedication to learning and improving my web development skills. Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have gained valuable insights and hands-on experience that will undoubtedly contribute to my growth as a web developer.

Thank you for providing me with this invaluable opportunity to learn and contribute to CodSoft. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the dynamic field of web development.


Sincerely,
Maanya Sikka
